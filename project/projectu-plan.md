# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Industrialization and Its Impact on India's Air Quality 

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How the Air Quality has been changed during the year depend on facotrs like change in environmental policy, growing economy, industrialization. i.e.,Are local trends in air quality detectable? Can we establish correlations between fluctuations in air quality and shifts in environmental policy within India? 

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
My plan is to explore how industrialization affects the environment negatively with respect to state environmental policies. Specifically, we will examine how an emerging economy like India is suffering from pollution due to industrialization, and how its environmental policies address these issues. We will focus solely on India, as we have data related to this country. Additionally, we will explore related and promising data, such as green energy and green finance, related to CO2 emission projections over the years. This will provide a more educated estimate regarding different factors.
